## Linting

This plugin comes with the following linting tools:

* ESlint - For JavaScript linting
* PHPCS - For PHP linting & coding standards
* Stylelint - For CSS/SaSS linting

In addition, some intelligent defaults are added via `@humanmade/coding-standards` (Composer) and `@humanmade/eslint-config` (NPM) that can be tweaked through configuration files.

## Testing

The following testing tools are bundled, as well, for different forms of user interaction and integration tests.

* TestCafe - For front-end, user-interaction-based testing
* PHPUnit - For PHP-based integration tests
* Robo - For any testing that requires a live environment

Combinations of these tools can be built into the `RoboFile.php`, e.g. spinning up a site and running TestCafe or PHPUnit tests that require database access against it.
