## Linting

* [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) - For PHP linting & coding standards
* [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - For CSS/SaSS linting

In addition, some intelligent defaults are added via [`@humanmade/coding-standards`](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards#readme) (Composer) and [`@humanmade/eslint-config`](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-humanmade/readme.md) (NPM) that can be tweaked through configuration files.

## Testing

The following testing tools are bundled, as well, for different forms of user interaction and integration tests.

* [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/) - For front-end, user-interaction-based testing
* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html) - For PHP-based integration tests
* [Robo](https://robo.li/) - For any testing that requires a live environment

Combinations of these tools can be built into the `RoboFile.php`, e.g. spinning up a site and running TestCafe or PHPUnit tests that require database access against it.
